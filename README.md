        <p>
            Merger and divestiture policies influence bargaining power in vertical relationships, a commonly underestimated factor. 
            I develop a Nash-bargaining model with endogenous bargaining weights. Next, I present a novel empirical framework to identify bounds 
            on the upstream bargaining weights between manufacturers and retailers at the brand level, solving bias due to endogenous selection of 
            divestiture packages. With this approach, I examine the impact of changes in bargaining weights under varying scenarios. Specifically, 
            I analyze a landmark U.S. merger, approved conditional on divestiture, and its effect on bargaining power, final prices, and consumer surplus. 
            Compared to a no-merger scenario, I estimate an increase in bargaining weights associated with divested brands and a decrease related to 
            the brands of the merged entity. This shift contributes to an overall rise in consumer surplus. Furthermore, I simulate consumer surplus outcomes 
            under alternative divestiture packages, revealing an alternative package with fewer divested brands that could have improved consumer welfare. 
            These findings add a novel angle to the recent discussions about the fact that antitrust authorities may have been too lax in the past decades.

                On Bargaining Power and the Inconsistencies Between Prices, Costs and Markups

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            This article examines the relationships between prices, markups, and costs in the US shampoo market from 2002 to 2012. 
            We find that real retail prices decreased during this period. This decline is not explained by a reduction in costs, but rather by an increase in retail bargaining power and a decrease in manufacturing markups. 
            Additionally, we estimate a moderate increase in downstream markups. These results suggest that changes in bargaining power is a key factor in understanding the evolution of markups and help to explain the inconsistencies between prices, costs and markups previously documented in the economic literature.
