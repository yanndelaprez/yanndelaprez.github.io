            <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Merger and divestiture policies influence bargaining power in vertical relationships, a commonly underestimated factor. I develop a Nash-bargaining model with endogenous bargaining weights. Next, I present a novel empirical framework to identify bounds on the upstream bargaining weights between manufacturers and retailers at the brand level, solving bias due to endogenous selection of divestiture packages. With this approach, I examine the impact of changes in bargaining weights under varying scenarios. Specifically, I analyze a landmark U.S. merger, approved conditional on divestiture, and its effect on bargaining power, final prices, and consumer surplus. Compared to a no-merger scenario, I estimate an increase in bargaining weights associated with divested brands and a decrease related to the brands of the merged entity. This shift contributes to an overall rise in consumer surplus. Furthermore, I simulate consumer surplus outcomes under alternative divestiture packages, revealing an alternative package with fewer divested brands that could have improved consumer welfare. These findings add a novel angle to the recent discussions about the fact that antitrust authorities may have been too lax in the past decades.</p>
