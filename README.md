      Unveiling Bargaining Impacts of Mergers and Divestitures
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Merger and divestiture policies influence bargaining power in vertical relationships,
    a commonly underestimated factor. I develop a Nash-bargaining model with endogenous
    bargaining weights. Next, I present a novel empirical framework to identify bounds on
    the upstream bargaining weights between manufacturers and retailers at the brand level
    and solve bias due to endogenous selection of divestiture packages. I analyze a landmark
    U.S. merger, approved conditional on divestiture, and its effect on bargaining power,
    final prices, and consumer surplus. Compared with a no-merger scenario, I estimate an
    increase in bargaining weights associated with divested brands and a decrease related
    to the brands of the merged entity. This shift contributes to an overall rise in consumer
    surplus. I further show that it is profitable for the merged firms to select a divestiture
    package so that the prices of the divested brands increase.

      Can Merger Remedies Cause More Harm than Good?
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    This paper investigates whether merger remedies, such as divestitures, can cause more
    harm than good using a model of firm conduct. The model is estimated leveraging the
    variation generated by a large divestiture in the U.S. beer market. First, I find that
    price coordination—materialised through conduct parameters—acts as a countervailing
    force that limits the pro-competitive effects of a divestiture, eliminating roughly
    80 %–133 % of the potential welfare gains. Second, counter-factual simulations show that
    a merger cleared with divestiture can reduce consumer surplus even more than a merger
    approved without any divestiture.

      Merger Remedies and Bargaining Power in the Coffee Market
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    This paper analyzes a merger of large manufacturers with divestiture in the French coffee
    market. In contrast to previous approaches that study the effects of upstream divestitures
    on prices and welfare, we model the vertical market structure. We show that the standard
    policy recommendation to require divestiture to small recipient firms may not hold once
    asymmetric bargaining power is considered. Prior models significantly over-estimate costs:
    our estimates are 12 % lower and suggest that divestiture can even create marginal-cost
    savings for the buyer of the divested brand.
