            Merger and divestiture policies influence bargaining power in vertical relationships, a commonly underestimated factor. I develop a Nash-bargaining model with endogenous bargaining weights. Next, I present a novel empirical framework to identify bounds on the upstream bargaining weights between manufacturers and retailers at the brand level and solve bias due to endogenous selection of divestiture packages. I analyze a landmark U.S. merger, approved conditional on divestiture, and its effect on bargaining power, final prices, and consumer surplus. Compared to a no-merger scenario, I estimate an increase in bargaining weights associated with divested brands and a decrease related to the brands of the merged entity. This shift contributes to an overall rise in consumer surplus. I further show that it is profitable for the merged firms to select a divestiture package so that the prices of the divested brands increase.
